# Personal Link Managmnet

This is a one-page personal about me website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a simple and clean design, with a focus on showcasing your existing social media following.

Goal is to create a one page Link Managmnet Page that is hosted free and can showcase some understanding of using Github. I chose this template as I liked the look and layout and is comparable to the alternatives below.
